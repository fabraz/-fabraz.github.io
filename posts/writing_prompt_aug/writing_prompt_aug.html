<p>The goal of this task was to auto-generate question/answer samples from writingPrompts to feed <a href="https://open-assistant.io/">openAssistant</a>.</p>

<p>To do that we should standardize the way a prompt was written. Our choice was to set prompt templates which might turn the generation process feasible. Here are the templates we applied:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base template: every prompt would have this sample. &gt; User: write me a story about: {stripped_prompt} -&gt; Rosey: Sure, here’s a story about: {stripped_prompt}:</li>
</ul>
<p>where <code>stripped_promt</code> is the cleared prompt output by regex pattern to take out parts of a prompt that would not fit the template. And <code>story</code> is the actual answer to a prompt.</p>
<ul>
<li>General constraints: a prompt whose constraint was found by regex pattern would have this also. &gt; Base template, {stripped_constraint} -&gt; Rosey: Sure, here’s a story about: {stripped_prompt}, {stripped_constraint}:</li>
</ul>
<p>where <code>stripped_constraint</code> is the constraint found.</p>
<ul>
<li>Answer beginning constraints: this constraint was imposed by the way the answer should start.<br>
&gt; Base template, starting with: {beggining} -&gt; Rosey: Sure, here’s a story about: {stripped_prompt}, starting with: {beggining}:</li>
</ul>
<p>where <code>beginning</code> is the first sentence of a story.</p>
<ul>
<li>Answer end constraints: this constraint was imposed by the way the answer should end.<br>
&gt; Base template, ending with: {ending} -&gt; Rosey: Sure, here’s a story about {stripped_prompt}: ending with: {ending}</li>
</ul>
<p>where <code>ending</code> is the last sentence of a story.</p>
<ul>
<li>Answer middle constraints: this constraint was imposed by the way the answer should have in its middle text.<br>
&gt; Base template, where the middle of the story is about: {middle} -&gt; Rosey: Sure, here’s a story about: {stripped_prompt}, where the middle of the story is about: {middle}:</li>
</ul>
<p>where <code>middle</code> is a summary of a story without the first and last sentence brought by a generative model</p>
<p>To get the samples we used the following pipeline:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get data</strong>: download from kaggle</li>
<li><strong>Pre-processing</strong>: load data from entails source/taget (aka: prompt/story) by every split (train/valid/test) merging into one pandas dataframe, enhancing tit with tabular info about the sample tags.</li>
<li><strong>Triage prompts</strong>: we pick prompts sorted by frequency, and we built regex pattern for some of them to extract a striped prompt and the related constraint.</li>
<li><strong>Split stories</strong>: after removing story beginning and ending sentences, we applied a sentence sliding window to get stories middle summaries.</li>
</ul>
